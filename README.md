- At the moment, I'm working on a **small game engine**, programmed in C++ using SFML and OpenGL. Once this will be done.
- When that will be finished, I'll resume my work on a **modular assembly compiler**, programmed in C. Once this will be done, I'll be working on an IDE programmed in C too using GTK.
- Note: Only a few of my projects are public. Hence, most languages I use on a weekly basis don't appear as most used. I'll be working on publishing more projects soon.
- Some of my public projects aren't completed, but are still public because they got interesting notions tools or whatever. When a project isn't finished, it will be said so in the Readme.md file.
- Fun fact about me: I worked on a PDF Generator in C++, so I had to learn the PDF language as well as PNG and JPEG format to handle images. In the future, I'll implement TTF files (font files) too.
